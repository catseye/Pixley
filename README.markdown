Pixley
======

Pixley is a strict subset of R5RS Scheme (or, if you prefer, R4RS Scheme),
supporting four datatypes (boolean, cons cell, function, and symbol) and
a dozen built-in symbols.  The reference implementation of Pixley
is written in 124 lines of Pixley (or, if you prefer, 124 lines of Scheme;
and if you prefer more Scheme-ly metrics, it consists of 413 instances of
54 unique symbols in 684 cons cells.)

This distribution also contains (non-reference) implementations of Pixley
in C (`mignon`) and Haskell (`haney`), as well as ancillary support for
running Pixley under four different implementations of Scheme (Racket's
`plt-r5rs`, Husk Scheme, Mini-Scheme v0.85p1, and Tinyscheme.)

Except where noted as being in the public domain, the source code files
in the Pixley project are distributed under a BSD license.

The latest released version of the Pixley language is 2.0.  For more
information on the language, reference implementation, and project, please
